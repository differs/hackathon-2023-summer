## Game route planning:

1. Resource gathering and infrastructure building: At the beginning of the game, players need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and ensure that the basic needs of the people are met, such as food, shelter, and safety. These resources can be obtained through means such as gathering, farming and mining.

2. Technology research: Players need to invest resources in technology research to improve the technology level of the city, so as to obtain more resources and higher efficiency. These technologies can cover agriculture, mining, construction, defense, and more.

3. Social Development: As the city continues to grow, players need to manage the city's residents to ensure their needs are met, while also taking into account the city's cultural and educational development. During this phase, the player needs to deal with political and economic issues such as collecting taxes, advising and managing resources within the city.

4. Diplomatic Relations: Players can obtain more resources and technologies by establishing diplomatic relations with other cities. Players need to consider how to manage relations with other cities, establish trade and alliances, and also need to keep the city's defense and safety.

5. World Exploration: Players can explore the world and discover new resources and territories. During the exploration, players need to pay attention to the dangers and challenges encountered, such as wild animals, natural disasters and other threats to civilization.

6. Rise of civilization: In the final stage of the game, players need to manage the development of the entire civilization and ensure the continued development of cities and countries. Players need to consider how to maintain the peace and prosperity of civilization, but also need to deal with various challenges and threats.

- second stage:
 Deployed to the Polkadot ecological chain. Including solidity development version and Ink development version, covering users of multiple chains

- The third phase:
 Launch PC and Android, IOS applications, lower the threshold for players to participate in the game, and guide more non-Web3 new users to enter the game
- Fourth stage:
 At this stage, the various gameplays of the game have basically been developed. Players on each chain can play against each other, and will expand their influence by holding events.

## Technology Architecture
**data storage**
- Some data, such as (user registration, role creation) and other information are stored in separate contracts, so that these data can be used without loss when other contracts are upgraded later
- Each function uses a separate contract, and the contracts call each other to facilitate later upgrades and only modify part of the contract
****


**Competitive gameplay**
- Develop trusted services to allow user data to be mapped to games
- Deploy a game network all over the world, so that players can play games online with low latency, making the game experience better
